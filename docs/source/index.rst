DiffuPath
=========
DiffuPath is an analytic tool for biological networks that connects the generic label propagation algorithms from
`DiffuPy <https://github.com/multipaths/DiffuPy/>`_ to biological networks encoded in several formats such as
Simple Interaction Format (SIF) or Biological Expression Language (BEL). For example, in the application scenario
presented in the paper, we use three pathway databases (i.e., KEGG, Reactome and WikiPathways) and their integrated
network retrieved from `PathMe <https://github.com/PathwayMerger/PathMe/>`_ [1]_ to analyze three multi-omics datasets.
However, other biological networks can be imported from the Bio2BEL ecosystem [2]_.

Installation is as easy as getting the code from `PyPI <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/diffupath>`_ with
:code:`python3 -m pip install diffupath`. See the :doc:`installation <installation>` documentation.
